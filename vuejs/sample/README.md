# Vue.js Sample Site Example

This is an example website which uses a Cloud CMS sample project as a backend and a Vue.js application as its frontend. 

To run, in the vuejs/sample directory:

1. Add your `gitana.json` file. You can get it by: Creating a sample project > Manage Project > API Keys
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build` to build the vue app.
4. Run `node app` to start the app server.
5. Navigate to localhost:2999/index.html

This example is not intended for production use, but rather to demonstrate how Cloud CMS might integrate with your Vue.js application.
